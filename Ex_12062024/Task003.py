# Leap Year Checker:
# Create a program that determines whether a given year is a leap year.
# A leap year is divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400.
# Use an if-else statement to make this determination.
# If the year is evenly divisible by 4, go to step 2. Otherwise, go to step 5.
# If the year is evenly divisible by 100, go to step 3. Otherwise, go to step 4.
# If the year is evenly divisible by 400, go to step 4. Otherwise, go to step 5.
# The year is a leap year (it has 366 days).
# The year is not a leap year (it has 365 days)
# Input = 2024
# Output = Leap year

year = int(input("Enter a year: "))
